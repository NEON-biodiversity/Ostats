#' Sample Circular Data
#'
#' This is a sample dataset with discrete hourly data collection from a study
#' in which ants were observed during 24-hour periods in multiple experimental
#' chambers. Each row represents an observation of an individual ant, with its
#' species identity and the time it was observed, rounded to the nearest hour.
#' The experimental setup is described in Stuble et al. 2014.
