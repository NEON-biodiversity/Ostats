#' Calculate O-statistics (community-level pairwise niche overlap statistics)
#'
#' This is the primary function in the Ostats package. It calculates O-statistics
#' by finding the trait density overlap among all pairs of species in each
#' community and taking the mean or median. Next it optionally evaluates the
#' O-statistics against a local null model.
#'
#' @param traits a numeric vector or matrix of trait measurements. The number of elements
#'   in the vector or number of rows in the matrix is the number of individuals,
#'   and the number of columns of the matrix is the number of traits.
#' @param plots a factor with length equal to \code{nrow(traits)} that indicates the
#'   community each individual belongs to.
#' @param sp a factor with length equal to \code{nrow(traits)} that indicates the taxon
#'   of each individual.
#' @param data_type data type can be "linear", "circular", or "circular_discrete".
#'  Defaults to "linear". See details below.
#' @param output specifies whether median or mean is calculated.
#' @param weight_type specifies weights to be used to calculate the median or mean.
#' @param run_null_model whether to run a null model (if \code{TRUE}) and evaluate the
#'  O-statistics against it, or simply return the raw O-statistics (if \code{FALSE}).
#'  Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
#' @param nperm the number of null model permutations to generate. Defaults to 99.
#' @param nullqs numeric vector of probabilities with values in [0,1] to set
#'   effect size quantiles. Defaults to \code{c(0.025, 0.975)}.
#' @param shuffle_weights If \code{TRUE}, shuffle weights given to pairwise overlaps
#'   within a community when generating null models.
#' @param swap_means If \code{TRUE}, swap means of body sizes within a community when
#'   generating null models.
#' @param random_seed User may supply a random seed to enable reproducibility
#'   of null model output. A warning is issued, and a random seed is generated
#'   based on the local time, if the user does not supply a seed.
#' @param unique_values Vector of all possible discrete values that \code{traits}
#'   can take. Only used if \code{data_type} is "circular_discrete".
#' @param circular_args optional list of additional arguments to pass to
#'  \code{\link[circular]{circular}}. Only used if the data type is "circular".
#'  Note that continuous circular data must be provided in radian units.
#' @param density_args additional arguments to pass to \code{\link[stats]{density}}, such as
#' \code{bw}, \code{n}, or \code{adjust}. If none are provided, default values
#' are used.
#'
#' @details This function calculates overlap statistics and optionally evaluates them
#'   against a local null model. By default, it calculates the median of pairwise
#'   overlaps, weighted by harmonic mean of species abundaces of the species
#'   pairs in each community. Two results are produced, one normalizing the area
#'   under all density functions to 1, the other making the area under all density
#'   functions proportional to the number of observations in that group.
#'
#'   If \code{data_type} is \code{"circular"}, the function \code{\link[circular]{circular}}
#'   is used to convert each column of \code{traits} to an object of class circular.
#'   Unless additional arguments about input data type are specified, it is
#'   assumed that the circular input data are in radian units (0 to 2*pi).
#'
#'   If \code{data_type} is \code{"circular_discrete"} data will be interpreted as
#'   discrete values on a circular scale. For example, data might be integer values
#'   representing hours and ranging from 0 to 23.
#'
#'   If \code{run_null_model} is \code{TRUE}, the O-statistics are evaluated relative
#'   to a null model. When both \code{shuffle_weights} and \code{swap_means} are \code{FALSE},
#'   null communities are generated by randomly assigning a taxon that is present in the community to
#'   each individual. If \code{shuffle_weights} is \code{TRUE}, species abundances
#'   are also randomly assigned to each species to weight the O-statistic for each
#'   null community. If \code{swap_means} is \code{TRUE}, instead of sampling individuals
#'   randomly, species means are sampled randomly among species, keeping the deviation
#'   of each individual from its species mean the same. After the null communities
#'   are generated, O-stats are then calculated to be compared against.
#'
#'   Effect size statistics are calculated by z-transforming the O-statistics
#'   using the mean and standard deviation of the null distribution.
#'
#' @return The function returns a list containing four objects:
#' \item{overlaps_norm}{a matrix showing the O-statistic for each trait and each community,
#'   with the area under all density functions normalized to 1.}
#' \item{overlaps_unnorm}{a matrix showing O-stats calculated with the area under all density
#'   functions proportional to the number of observations in that group.}
#' \item{overlaps_norm_ses}{List of matrices of effect size statistics against a null model
#'   with the area under all density functions normalized to 1. \code{ses} contains the
#'   effect sizes (z-scores), \code{ses_lower} contains the effect size lower critical values
#'   for significance at the level determined by \code{nullqs}, and \code{ses_upper}
#'   contains the upper critical values. \code{raw_lower} and \code{raw_upper} are
#'   the critical values in raw units ranging from 0 to 1.}
#' \item{overlaps_unnorm_ses}{List of matrices of effect size statistics against a null model
#'   with the area under all density functions proportional to the number
#'   of observations in that group. Elements are as in \code{overlaps_norm_ses}.}
