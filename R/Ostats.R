#' Calculate O-statistics (community-level pairwise niche overlap statistics)
#'
#' This is the primary function in the Ostats package. It evaluates the
#' O-statistics against a local null model.
#'
#' @param traits a matrix dataset with nrows = n individuals, ncols = n traits.
#' @param plots a factor with length equal to nrow(traits) that indicates the
#'   community each individual belongs to.
#' @param sp a factor with length equal to nrow(traits) that indicates the taxon
#'   of each individual.
#' @param nperm the number of permutations to generate a null model.
#' @param nullqs numeric vector of probabilities with values in [0,1] to set
#'   effect size quantiles.
#' @param shuffle_weights If TRUE, shuffle weights given to pairwise overlaps
#'   within a community when generating null models.
#' @param swap_means If TRUE, swap means of body sizes within a community when
#'   generating null models.
#'
#' @details This function evaluates the overlap statistics against a local null
#'   model.The function community_overlap_harmonicwmedian calculates the median
#'   of pairwise overlaps of trait distributions of all species in each
#'   community, weighted by harmonic mean of species abundaces of the species
#'   pairs in each community. Two results are produced, one assuming the kernel
#'   densities are normally distributed, and the other assuming the kernel
#'   densities are not normalized, thus each density entry is multiplied by the
#'   length of each vector before computing the overlap coefficients.
#'
#'   When both shuffle_weights and swap_means are FALSE, null models are
#'   generated by randomly assigning a taxon that is present in the community to
#'   each individual. The medians of pairwise overlaps are then calculated to be
#'   compared against.
#'
#'   Effect size statistics are calculated between the median for each community
#'   and the null model.

#'
#' @return The funtion returns a list containing 4 objects: overlaps_norm, which
#'   is the median of weighted pairwise overlaps of trait distributions of all
#'   species in each community, assuming normal distribution. overlaps_unnorm,
#'   the medians calculated assuming kernel densities are not normalized.
#'   overlaps_norm_ses, effect size statistics against a null model assuming
#'   normal distribution, and overlaps_unnorm_ses, effect size statistics with
#'   the additional normalization step.
