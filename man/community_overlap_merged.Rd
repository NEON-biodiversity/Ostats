community_overlap_merged(
  traits,
  sp,
  data_type = "linear",
  normal = TRUE,
  output = "median",
  weight_type = "hmean",
  randomize_weights = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{traits}{A numeric vector of trait measurements with length equal to the number of individuals. Each individual should have a trait measurement.}

\item{sp}{A factor vector with length equal to the number of elements in the traits vector that indicates the taxon of each individual.}

\item{data_type}{Data type can be "linear", "circular", or "circular_discrete". The data_type argument defaults to "linear" and is appropriate when the trait data are one dimensional (i.e., body masses of individuals). The alternative inputs for this argument are for circular data that are periodic or discoid (e.g., measured in radians or degrees). The argument "circular" is for continuous data and the argument "circular_discrete" is for non-continuous, hourly data.}

\item{normal}{If TRUE, then the area under all density functions is normalized to one. TRUE is the default for this argument.
If FALSE, then the area under all density functions is proportional to the number of observations in that group.}

\item{output}{The arguments *output* specifies the whether the median or mean of all pairwise overlap values between distributions of species will be returned. The default value for output is "median".}

\item{weight_type}{Specifies weights to be used to calculate the median or mean output. When the default value for *weight_type* = "hmean", the function calculates the pairwise overlaps of trait distributions of all species in each community as 2/(1/abundance of species a + 1/abundance of species b). The harmonic mean *weight_type* is set as the default as it minimizes the effect of outliers and rare species. If the argument weight_type = "none", no weights are used for the calculation of mean or median. If weight_type = "mean", raw abundances of species are used as weights.}

\item{randomize_weights}{If randomize_weights is TRUE, the weights given to pairwise overlaps within a community are shuffled when generating null models. The default is set to FALSE, so that weights of pairwise overlaps are not shuffled.}

\item{circular_args}{Optional list of additional arguments to pass to
\code{\link[circular]{circular}}. Only used if the data_type argument is set to "circular".}

\item{density_args}{Additional arguments to pass to \code{\link[stats]{density}}, such as
\code{bw}, \code{n}, or \code{adjust}. If none are provided, default values
of bw = "nrd0", adjust = 1, and n = 512 are used.}
}
\value{
The function returns overall species overlap for a community. At default, it returns the
median of pairwise overlaps weighted by harmonic means of abundances for the community.
}
\description{
This function calculates the median or mean of pairwise overlaps between density
estimates of trait distributions of all species within a community, which can
be weighted by species abundances.
}
\details{
The function evaluates weighted mean or median of overlaps of density
estimates of all species in a community taking complete cases with species abundances
greater than 1 from the dataset. The default calculates the median of pairwise overlaps
for the whole community using the harmonic means of abundances of the species pairs as
weights, which minimizes the effect of outliners and rare species.If the argument
weight_type = "none", no weights are used for the calculation of mean/median. If
weight_type = "mean", arithmetic means of abundances are used as weights. To change the
output to mean, specify the argument output = "mean".
