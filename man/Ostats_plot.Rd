\arguments{
\item{indiv_dat}{Individual data: a data frame containing individual measurments for a certain
trait,its species identity, and the community identity it belongs to.}

\item{plots}{Site identity: a column in indiv_dat data frame that indicates the names of each community.}

\item{sp}{Taxon identity: a column in indiv_dat data frame that indicates species or taxa names.}

\item{traits}{you want to overlap among species: a column in indiv_dat data frame containing traits measurements for each individual.}

\item{overlap_dat}{an object containing the results from the Ostats function - see \code{\link{Ostats}}}

\item{sites2use}{a vector that select the sites you want to plot. If NULL, the function will plot all the sites.}

\item{n_col}{Number of columns for layout of individual panels. Default is 1.}

\item{scale}{If you want the scale of x, y or both x and y axis to be adjusted according to each site density probability set the argument to "free_x", "free_y" or "free" respectively. Default= "fixed" which uses the same scale across all sites.}

\item{colorvalues}{Vector of color values for the density polygons. Defaults to a viridis palette if none provided.}

\item{adjust}{multiplicate the bandwidth adjustment of the density polygons. The less, the tiny your density polygons will be. Default is 2.}

\item{limits_x}{the limits (min and max values) of the x axis. Default is \code{c(0.5*min(traits,na.rm=TRUE), 1.5*max(traits,na.rm=TRUE))}}

\item{name_x}{a character indicating the name of your x axis (i.e. the name of your trait). Default is 'traits value'}

\item{name_y}{a character indicating the name of your y axis. Default is 'Probability Density'}

\item{means}{if TRUE it plot traits means for each species in an additionlan plot column next to the traits distribution plots for each site. Default is FALSE, which make the function plot only the traits distribution for each site.}

\item{alpha_o}{defines the colors trasparency level for the density polygons. Default is 0.5}
}
\value{
Density plots of species trait distribution plotted on the same graph
 for each community to show how they overlap each other. The overlap value obtained as output from the function \code{\link{Ostats}}, is labelled on each community graph.
}
\description{
This function plots the overlap of traits among
 species for each community.

#load data:
#indiv_dat <- read_csv('https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/9167548', col_names = T)

#set the arguments:
#overlap_dat <- Ostats_bysite2015 #your results from the Ostat function - see \code{\link{Ostats}}
#plots <- indiv_dat$siteID
#sp <- indiv_dat$taxonID
#traits <- indiv_dat$logweight

#to plot only selected sites:
#sites2use<- c('BART','KONZ','JORN')

#to plot all sites:
sites2use<- NULL


#Ostats_plot(indiv_dat = indiv_dat, plots = plots, sp = sp, traits = traits, overlap_dat = overlap_dat, sites2use = sites2use, means=T)
