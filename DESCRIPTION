Description: The Ostats package calculates overlap statistic to measure the degree of community-level trait overlap by 
    fitting nonparametric kernel density functions to each speciesâ€™ trait distribution and calculating their areas of overlap.
    For instance, the median pairwise overlap for a community is calculated by first determining the overlap of each species pair 
    in trait space, and then taking the median overlap of each species pair in a community. 
    This median overlap value is called the O-statistic (O for overlap).
    The Ostats() function calculates separate univariate overlap statistics for each trait, 
    while the Ostats_multivariate() function calculates a single multivariate overlap statistic for all traits. 
    O-statistics can be evaluated against null models to obtain standardized effect sizes. 
    Ostats is part of the collaborative Macrosystems Biodiversity Project "Local- to continental-scale drivers of biodiversity 
    across the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)."" For more information on this project, see the 
    Macrosystems Biodiversity Website (<https://neon-biodiversity.github.io/>).
